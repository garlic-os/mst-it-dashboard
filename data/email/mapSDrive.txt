Hello[custName],

You've requested instructions on how to map your S: drive on your machine. Please perform the following steps to do so for a Windows computer:

1. Ensure that you are connected to the MST campus network or are using campus VPN.
2. Click the Start Button, then open "File Explorer". From there, you will need to open "My Computer". If you are Windows 7 this is called "Computer"; if you are on Windows 10, it is called "This PC".
3. From the menu on the top, select "Map Network Drive".
4. Change the Drive letter to "S:". If this label is already in use, choosing a different letter will also work just fine.
5. In the folder box, enter the following: \\minerfiles.mst.edu\dfs\users\{your username}
6. Mark the box "Connect using different credentials"
7. A dialog box should now appear asking you for a username and password. Your username will be MST-USERS\{your username}. Your password will be your university password.
8. Your S: drive should now be mapped. You can access your files through the Network Locations section under "Computer" in the start menu.
