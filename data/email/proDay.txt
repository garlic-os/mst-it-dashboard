Hello[custName],

To make things easier on PRO Day or Transfer Day make sure to:

  - Step 1: Set up your student account 
  - Step 2: Sign the e-consent for Joe'SS
  - Step 3: Activate your email account

at http://it.mst.edu/pro/ and follow the steps provided.

If you don't complete the three steps above, you will have to stop by IT during your transfer/proday visit.

For assistance you can contact the IT Help Desk by calling (573) 341-4357 (HELP), visiting the IT Help Desk on the first floor of the Curtis Laws Wilson Library, or updating this ticket online at http://help.mst.edu. 

Thank You,
S&T IT Help Desk
