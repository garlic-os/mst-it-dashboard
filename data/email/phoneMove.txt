Hello[custName],

To have one of our IT Technicians move your office phone, there is a minimum fee of $35 per hour. Please provide a MOCODE and we will assign your ticket to the technicians. However if you would like to move your phone yourself, make sure that the phone is plugged into a port with a red dot beside it. Please let us know if you would like for IT to move your phone and provide a MOCODE, or if you will move your own phone and we can resolve this ticket. 

[resolving]For assistance you can contact the IT Help Desk by calling (573) 341-4357 (HELP), visiting the IT Help Desk on the first floor of the Curtis Laws Wilson Library, or [tickOpen] updating this ticket online at http://help.mst.edu. [tickUpdateInfo]
	
Thank You,
S&T IT Help Desk
