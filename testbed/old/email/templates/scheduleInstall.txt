Hello,

This is the IT Help Desk. We have received a request to install [scheduleInst_software] on [scheduleInst_comp]. In order for us to do so, we will need to schedule a time for one of our technicians to remote desktop in to the computer and complete the install manually. Please provide a time during which the computer will be turned on, connected to the campus internet, and all users logged out. 

To update this ticket, you can contact the IT Help Desk by calling (573) 341-4357 (HELP), visiting the IT Help Desk on the first floor of the Curtis Laws Wilson Library, or [tickOpen] ticket online at http://help.mst.edu. [tickUpdateInfo]

Thank you,
Missouri S&T
